## Latency Arbitrage Signal Processing with NBBO

This project identifies potential latency arbitrage opportunities using high-frequency order flow data and NBBO quotes. It preprocesses and filters the dataset to extract signals based on stale quote detection and quote imbalance across exchanges.
The core logic is modular and extensible for analyzing market microstructure patterns.

Next Step: Implement a P&L engine to simulate execution and quantify strategy performance.
